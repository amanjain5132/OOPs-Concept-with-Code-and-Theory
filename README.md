<h1 >OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOPs) IN JAVA. </h1>
<p align="left">

<a> <tr> Object-Oriented Programming </tr> is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below : </a>

<p> ( When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory.) </p>

<h1 > Java - What is OOP? </h1>

<p> OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. </p>

<p> Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>

<h2> Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming: </h2>

<p> OOP is faster and easier to execute </p>
<p> OOP provides a clear structure for the programs </p>
<p> OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug </p>
<p> OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time </p>
<p> Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it. </p>
